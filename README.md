## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** inside the project folder by pressing ctrl+` basically the terminal window (e.g., `C:\Users\User\Desktop\cook`).

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv cook_env

# (For PowerShell) Allow running scripts
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Activate the virtual environment
cook_env\Scripts\activate

Once the virtual environment is active, install all dependencies from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Add Your Groq API Key

Open the file cookmate_rag.py 
You‚Äôll find a line like this near the top:

 api_key = os.getenv(key)


Replace "key" with your actual Groq API key, for example:

 api_key = os.getenv('actual key here')
Step 5: Run the Backend

Run the following command inside your activated environment:

python cookmate_rag.py

Step 6: Run the Streamlit App

Now start the Streamlit interface by running:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py


This will launch the CookMate web interface in your browser.
